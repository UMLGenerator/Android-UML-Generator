General User Story

A developer wants to be able to trace the execution of a phone application visually. An easy way to do this is to look at a UML Diagram of the execution. There is no easy way to do this through base android functionality. This is where our application comes in handy. It allows the user to select an application in our GUI, and then trace the execution of the application. The end resulting being a nice UML Diagram that the developer can view
