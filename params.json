  "body": "### Purpose\r\nExecution flows of applications can sometimes be difficult to visualize without having UML\r\ndiagrams. In particular, sequence diagrams allow for the capture of flow logic, logic\r\nmethods, usage program, and logic of services of a program. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to automatically generate sequence diagrams based on the usage of an application. We also generate an XMI file so that the UML diagram can be imported into StarUML.\r\n\r\n### Video Demonstartion\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/14tjh9iDq30\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
