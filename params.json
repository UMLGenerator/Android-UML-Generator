  "body": "### Purpose\r\nExecution flows of applications can sometimes be difficult to visualize without having UML\r\ndiagrams. In particular, sequence diagrams allow for the capture of flow logic, logic\r\nmethods, usage program, and logic of services of a program. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to automatically generate sequence diagrams based on the usage of an application. We also generate an XMI file so that the UML diagram can be imported into StarUML.\r\n\r\n### Video Demonstartion (Click to be redirected to youtube)\r\n[![Click here to be directed to the video!](http://img.youtube.com/vi/14tjh9iDq30/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14tjh9iDq30 \"Android UML Generator Demo\")\r\n\r\n### Workflow Overview\r\n![](https://github.com/UMLGenerator/Android-UML-Generator/blob/master/artifacts/ApplicationStructure.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Tools Used\r\n\r\n### Using Android UML Generator\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMiles Peele (@mformetal)\r\nTristan Vernon (@Caedus13)\r\nJake Shor (@JakeShor)\r\nTim Fulton (@tmfulton)\r\n\r\n",
