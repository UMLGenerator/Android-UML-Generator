  "body": "### Purpose\r\nExecution flows of applications can sometimes be difficult to visualize without having UML\r\ndiagrams. In particular, sequence diagrams allow for the capture of flow logic, logic\r\nmethods, usage program, and logic of services of a program. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to automatically generate sequence diagrams based on the usage of an application. We also generate an XMI file so that the UML diagram can be imported into StarUML.\r\n\r\n### Video Demonstration (Click to be redirected to youtube)\r\n[![Click here to be directed to the video!](http://img.youtube.com/vi/14tjh9iDq30/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14tjh9iDq30 \"Android UML Generator Demo\")\r\n\r\n### Workflow Overview\r\n![](https://github.com/UMLGenerator/Android-UML-Generator/blob/master/artifacts/ApplicationStructure.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Tools Used\r\n* [Xposed](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)\r\n- Module used to gather data about which methods and classes are used my an application\r\n* [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/)\r\n- Program used to take text file and turn it into a UML sequence diagram\r\n* [StarUML](http://staruml.io/)\r\n- Program that XMI can be imported into for modification of sequence diagram\r\n* [SimpleXML](http://simple.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- Framework used to make the process of writing XMI easier\r\n* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n- Framework used to run backend\r\n\r\n### Using Android UML Generator\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMiles Peele (@mformetal)\r\nTristan Vernon (@Caedus13)\r\nJake Shor (@JakeShor)\r\nTim Fulton (@tmfulton)\r\n",
