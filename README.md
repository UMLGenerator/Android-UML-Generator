# Android-UML-Generator
Execution flows in the applications sometimes can be difficult to visualize without having UML diagrams. In particular sequence diagrams allows to capture the flow logic of a program, logic methods, usage program, and logic of services. This type of diagrams can be represented using UML notation and in order to export this diagram some programs like Enterprise Architect use the XMI specification. The goals of this project are to automatically generate sequence diagrams based on the usage of the application, and also link the high­level GUI events into the low­level method calls.
